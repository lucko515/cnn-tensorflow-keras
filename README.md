# Convolutional neural network in TensorFlow and Keras

In this repository you can find out how to implement CNN in Tensorflow/Keras for multiclass classification.

## Dataset

Dataset used in this project is MNIST dataset. You can download it by using built-in TensorFlow functions. For more explanation open the .ipynb file.

## Install

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supported Python version
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Python version used in this project: 3.5+

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Libraries used

> *  [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org) 1.2.0
> *  [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org) 1.10.4
> *  [Time]()
> *  [tqdm](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tqdm) 4.15.0

## Code

The tensorflow version of CNN is inside **CNN_tensorflow_classification.ipynb**.

The Keras version is insider **Keras_cnn.ipynb**.

## Run

To run this project you will need some software, like Anaconda, which provides support for running .ipynb files (Jupyter Notebook).

After making sure you have that, you can run from a terminal or cmd next lines (Example  for Keras version):

`ipython notebook Keras_cnn.ipynb`

or

`jupyter notebook Keras_cnn.ipynb`
